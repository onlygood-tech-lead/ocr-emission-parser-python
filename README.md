OCR Project: Tesseract, EasyOCR, and Requests API :
This repository provides a robust OCR (Optical Character Recognition) solution using Tesseract, EasyOCR, and an external Requests API. It allows you to extract text from images, offering flexibility by combining local OCR libraries with external APIs for improved accuracy and functionality.

Features:
-Tesseract OCR: Local OCR engine with support for various languages and high customization.
-EasyOCR: Lightweight OCR library for quick and accurate text extraction.
-Requests API: Integrates with external OCR APIs for additional capabilities.
-Handles multiple image formats (PNG, JPEG, etc.).
-Includes error handling for API requests and preprocessing for enhanced OCR accuracy.

Technologies Used:
-Python: Scripting and processing.
-Tesseract OCR: Local OCR processing.
-EasyOCR: Python library for OCR.
-Requests API: To connect to an external OCR service.
-Pillow: For image preprocessing.

How Each Method Works:
1. Tesseract OCR
-Uses the pytesseract library for text extraction.
Suitable for local processing with customizable configurations like language settings and page segmentation modes.
2. EasyOCR
-Provides a pre-trained OCR model that supports multiple languages.
Lightweight and ideal for quick results without additional setup.
3. Requests API
-Sends images to an external API for processing.
Useful for advanced OCR features like handwriting recognition or multi-language support.
